1. why we use span element?
   The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline element.

2. The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic). The <hr> element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

3. difference em and rem
   While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size. em gives the ability to control an area of a design. As in, scale the type in that specific area relatively. rem gives the ability to scale type across the entire page easily.
